# vulnerability-visualization

Some ruby and javascript I hacked together to solve a business use case.  Workflow goes like this:

[Scanner] <- Pull Scan Data <- Generate Risk Metrics -> [CSV files] <- JavaScript -> Google Charts API -> Pretty Graphs

![Horizontal Bar Chart](/img/vizfish-3.png?raw=true "Current Asset Group Risk Rankings")
![Asset Group Rankings with Historical Comparison](/img/vizfish-2.png?raw=true "Black line represents previous month's risk")
![Asset Group Specific Metrics](/img/vizfish-1.png?raw=true "More granular metrics to analyze related vulnerabilities by service and system configuration drift")
